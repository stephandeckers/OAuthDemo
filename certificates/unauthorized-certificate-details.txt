Usage:
This certificate is intentionally NOT configured in OAuthApi's appsettings.json.
It is used to demonstrate that OAuth validation is working correctly by:
1. Attempting to authenticate with this certificate
2. Receiving an "Unauthorized" response from OAuthApi
3. Proving that only authorized certificates can obtain JWT tokens

IMPORTANT: This proves OAuth security is working!
